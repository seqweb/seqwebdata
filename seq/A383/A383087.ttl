To construct sqrt(3), draw two unit circles, centered at each of the two starting points. These unit circles intersect in two places, which are a distance of sqrt(3) apart.
To construct 2, draw a unit circle along with the line connecting the starting points. The line marks two points that are opposite of each other on the unit circle.
For n = 3, we additionally can construct 3 and 4."""@en .
