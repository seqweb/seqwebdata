It is likely 4 is the only positive integer not to appear. Interestingly if we force the sequence to be composed of only terms greater than 1, the only term that differs is a(4), which becomes 4 instead of 1, with all other terms remaining the same.
In the first 10000 terms the only fixed points are 21 and 104. It is unknown if more exist."""@en .

a(4) = 1. As this term has not been previous referenced, 1 can be chosen. Note this eliminates 4 as a possible term for the remainder of the sequence as a(4) cannot share a factor with any other number. Note that as a(a(4)) = a(1) = 2, a(5) must be an index to an even number.
a(5) = 7. As previously noted, no term can be 4, and a(5) must be an index to an even number, so it cannot be 5 itself. The number 6 has been used, so that leaves 7 as the smallest possible choice. Note this now forces a(7) to share a factor with a(a(4)) = a(1) = 2."""@en .
