In a regular N-gon inscribed in a unit circle, the side length is d(N,1) = 2*sin(Pi/N). The length ratio R(N,k):=d(N,k)/d(N,1) for the (k-1)-th diagonal, with k from {2,3,...,floor(N/2)}, N >= 4, equals S(k-1,x) = sin(k*Pi/N)/sin(Pi/N) with x=rho(N):=R(N,2) = 2*cos(Pi/N). Example: N=7 (heptagon), rho=R(7,2), sigma:=R(N,3) = S(2,rho) = rho^2 - 1. Motivated by the quoted paper by P. Steinbach. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Dec 02 2010

In q- or basic analysis, q-numbers are [n]_q := S(n-1,q+1/q) = (q^n-(1/q)^n)/(q-1/q), with the row polynomials S(n,x), n >= 0.
The zeros of the row polynomials S(n-1,x) are (from those of Chebyshev U-polynomials):
  x(n-1;k) = +- t(k,rho(n)), k = 1..ceiling((n-1)/2), n >= 2, with t(n,x) the row polynomials of A127672 and rho(n):= 2*cos(Pi/n). The simple vanishing zero for even n appears here as +0 and -0.
Factorization of the row polynomials S(n-1,x), x >= 1, in terms of the minimal polynomials of cos(2 Pi/2), called Psi(n,x), with coefficients given by A181875/A181876:
  S(n-1,x) = (2^(n-1))*Product_{n>=1}(Psi(d,x/2), 2 < d | 2n).

This is an example for a subclass of Riordan convolution arrays (lower triangular matrices) called Bell arrays. See the L. W. Shapiro et al. reference under A007318. If a Riordan array is named (G(z),F(z)) with F(z)=z*Fhat(z), the o.g.f. for the row polynomials is G(z)/(1-x*z*Fhat(z)), and it becomes a Bell array if G(z)=Fhat(z). For the present Bell type triangle G(z)=1/(1+z^2) (see the o.g.f. comment above). This leads to the o.g.f. for the column no. k, k >= 0, x^k/(1+x^2)^(k+1) (see the formula section), the one for the row sums and for the alternating row sums (see comments above). The Riordan (Bell) A- and Z-sequences (defined in a W. Lang link under A006232, with references) have o.g.f.s 1-x*c(x^2) and -x*c(x^2), with the o.g.f. of the Catalan numbers A000108. Together they lead to a recurrence given in the formula section. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Nov 04 2011
The determinant of the N x N matrix S(N,[x[1], ..., x[N]]) with elements S(m-1,x[n]), for n, m = 1, 2, ..., N, and for any x[n], is identical with the determinant of V(N,[x[1], ..., x[N]]) with elements x[n]^(m-1) (a Vandermondian, which equals Product_{1 <= i < j<= N} (x[j] - x[i])). This is a special instance of a theorem valid for any N >= 1 and any monic polynomial system p(m,x), m>=0, with p(0,x) = 1. For this theorem see the Vein-Dale reference, p. 59. Thanks to _L. Edson Jeffery_ for an email asking for a proof of the non-singularity of the matrix S(N,[x[1], ...., x[N]]) if and only if the x[j], j = 1..N, are pairwise distinct. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Aug 26 2013
These S polynomials also appear in the context of modular forms. The rescaled Hecke operator T*_n = n^((1-k)/2)*T_n acting on modular forms of weight k satisfies T*_(p^n) = S(n, T*_p), for each prime p and positive integer n. See the Koecher-Krieg reference, p. 223. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jan 22 2016

Solutions of the Diophantine equation u^2 + v^2 - k*u*v = 1 for integer k given by (u(k,n), v(k,n)) = (S(n,k), S(n-1,k)) because of the Cassini-Simson identity: S(n,x)^2 - S(n+1,x)*S(n-1, x) = 1, after use of the S-recurrence. Note that S(-n, x) = -S(-n-2, x), n >= 1, and the periodicity of some S(n, k) sequences.
Hence another way to obtain the row polynomials would be to take powers of the matrix [x, -1; 1,0]: S(n, x) = (([x, -1; 1, 0])^n)[1,1], n >= 0.
See also a Feb 01 2016 comment on A115139 for a well-known S(n, x) sum formula.
Then we have with the present T triangle
  A039834(n) = -i^(n+1)*T(n-1, k) where i is the imaginary unit and n >= 0.
  A051286(n) = Sum_{i=0..n} T(n,i)^2 (see the _Philippe Deléham_, Nov 21 2005 formula),
  A181545(n) = Sum_{i=0..n+1} abs(T(n,i)^3),
  A181546(n) = Sum_{i=0..n+1} T(n,i)^4,
  A181547(n) = Sum_{i=0..n+1} abs(T(n,i)^5).
S(n, 0) = A056594(n), and for k = 1..10 the sequences S(n-1, k) with offset n = 0 are A128834, A001477, A001906, A001353, A004254, A001109, A004187, A001090, A018913, A004189.

The o.g.f. for the Legendre polynomials L(n,x) is 1 / sqrt(1- 2x*z + z^2), and squaring it gives the o.g.f. of U(n,x), A053117, so Sum_{k=0..n} L(k,x/2) L(n-k,x/2) = S(n,x). This gives S(n,x) = L(n/2,x/2)^2 + 2*Sum_{k=0..n/2-1} L(k,x/2) L(n-k,x/2) for n even and S(n,x) = 2*Sum_{k=0..(n-1)/2} L(k,x/2) L(n-k,x/2) for odd n.

Exp(LG(x,h1,h2)) = 1 / (1 - h1*x + h2*x^2 ) is the o.g.f. of the bivariate row polynomials of this entry. - _Tom Copeland_, Feb 15 2016 (Instances of the bivariate o.g.f. for this entry are on pp. 5 and 18 of Sunada. - _Tom Copeland_, Jan 18 2021)
For distinct odd primes p and q the Legendre symbol can be written as Legendre(q,p) = Product_{k=1..P} S(q-1, 2*cos(2*Pi*k/p)), with P = (p-1)/2. See the Lemmermeyer reference, eq. (8.1) on p. 236. Using the zeros of S(q-1, x) (see above) one has S(q-1, x) = Product_{l=1..Q} (x^2 - (2*cos(Pi*l/q))^2), with Q = (q-1)/2. Thus S(q-1, 2*cos(2*Pi*k/p)) = ((-4)^Q)*Product_{l=1..Q} (sin^2(2*Pi*k/p) - sin^2(Pi*l/q)) = ((-4)^Q)*Product_{m=1..Q} (sin^2(2*Pi*k/p) - sin^2(2*Pi*m/q)). For the proof of the last equality see a W. Lang comment on the triangle A057059 for n = Q and an obvious function f. This leads to Eisenstein's proof of the quadratic reciprocity law Legendre(q,p) = ((-1)^(P*Q)) * Legendre(p,q), See the Lemmermeyer reference, pp. 236-237. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Aug 28 2016

The number of zeros Z(n) of the S(n, x) polynomials in the open interval (-1,+1) is 2*b(n) for even n >= 0 and 1 + 2*b(n) for odd n >= 1, where b(n) = floor(n/2) - floor((n+1)/3). This b(n) is the number of integers k in the interval (n+1)/3 < k <= floor(n/2). See a comment on the zeros of S(n, x) above, and b(n) = A008615(n-2), n >= 0. The numbers Z(n) have been proposed (with a conjecture related to A008611) by _Michel Lagneau_, Mar 2017, as the number of zeros of Fibonacci polynomials on the imaginary axis (-I,+I), with I=sqrt(-1). They are Z(n) = A008611(n-1), n >= 0, with A008611(-1) = 0. Also Z(n) = A194960(n-4), n >= 0. Proof using the A008611 version. A194960 follows from this.
In general the number of zeros Z(a;n) of S(n, x) for n >= 0 in the open interval (-a,+a) for a from the interval (0,2) (x >= 2 never has zeros, and a=0 is trivial: Z(0;n) = 0) is with b(a;n) = floor(n//2) - floor((n+1)*arccos(a/2)/Pi), as above Z(a;n) = 2*b(a;n) for even n >= 0 and 1 + 2*b(a;n) for odd n >= 1. For the closed interval [-a,+a] Z(0;n) = 1 and for a from (0,1) one uses for Z(a;n) the values b(a;n) = floor(n/2) - ceiling((n+1)*arccos(a/2)/Pi) + 1. (End)
The Riordan row polynomials S(n, x) (Chebyshev S) belong to the Boas-Buck class (see a comment and references in A046521), hence they satisfy the Boas-Buck identity: (E_x - n*1)*S(n, x) = (E_x + 1)*Sum_{p=0..n-1} (1 - (-1)^p)*(-1)^((p+1)/2)*S(n-1-p, x), for n >= 0, where E_x = x*d/dx (Euler operator). For the triangle T(n, k) this entails a recurrence for the sequence of column k, given in the formula section. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Aug 11 2017
The e.g.f. E(x,t) := Sum_{n>=0} (t^n/n!)*S(n,x) for the row polynomials is obtained via inverse Laplace transformation from the above given o.g.f. as E(x,t) = ((1/xm)*exp(t/xm) - (1/xp)*exp(t/xp) )/(xp - xm) with xp = (x + sqrt(x^2-4))/2 and xm = (x - sqrt(x^2-4))/2. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Nov 08 2017

Factorization of row polynomials S(n, x), for n >= 1, in terms of C polynomials (not Chebyshev C) with coefficients given in A187360. This is obtained from the factorization into Psi polynomials (see the Jul 12 2011 comment above) but written in terms of minimal polynomials of 2*cos(2*Pi/n) with coefficients in A232624:
S(2*k, x) = Product_{2 <= d | (2*k+1)} C(d, x)*(-1)^deg(d)*C(d, -x), with deg(d) = A055034(d) the degree of C(d, x).
S(2*k+1, x) = Product_{2 <= d | 2*(k+1)} C(d, x) * Product_{3 <= 2*d + 1 | (k+1)} (-1)^(deg(2*d+1))*C(2*d+1, -x).
Note that (-1)^(deg(2*d+1))*C(2*d+1, -x)*C(2*d+1, x) pairs always appear.
The number of C factors of S(2*k, x), for k >= 0, is 2*(tau(2*k+1) - 1) = 2*(A099774(k+1) - 1) = 2*A095374(k), and for S(2*k+1, x), for k >= 0, it is tau(2*(k+1)) + tau_{odd}(k+1) - 2 = A302707(k), with tau(2*k+1) = A099774(k+1), tau(n) = A000005 and tau(2*(k+1)) = A099777(k+1).
For the reverse problem, the factorization of C polynomials into S polynomials, see A255237. (End)

Here log(z) = |z| + Arg(z)*i, with Arg(z) from [-Pi,+Pi) (principal branch). This satisfies the recurrence relation for S because it is derived from the Binet - de Moivre formula for S. Examples: S(n/m, 0) = cos((n/m)*Pi/4), for n >= 0 and m >= 1. S(n*i, 0) = (1/2)*(1 + exp(n*Pi))*exp(-(n/2)*Pi), for n >= 0. S(1+i, 2+i) = 0.6397424847... + 1.0355669490...*i.

For the 8th row starting at a(36) the 5 consecutive nonzero entries in order are 1,-10,15,-7,1 given by c = 4,3,2,1,0 and b = 0,2,4,6,8. - _Richard Turk_, Aug 20 2017
O.g.f.: exp( Sum_{n >= 0} 2*T(n,x/2)*t^n/n ) = 1 + x*t + (-1 + x^2)*t^2 + (-2*x + x^3)*t^3 + (1 - 3*x^2 + x^4)*t^4 + ..., where T(n,x) denotes the n-th Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind. - _Peter Bala_, Aug 15 2022"""@en .
