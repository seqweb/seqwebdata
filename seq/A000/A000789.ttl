The sequence may be considered as consisting of a special kind of Ramsey numbers. It is related to the ordinary two-color Ramsey numbers R(3,n), given in A000791, by the relation a(n) <= A000791(n)-1 as proved by Kalbfleisch. He also calculated the first eight terms, and noted that the inequality sometimes is strict. The first n for which this happens is n=6.
The terms a(10), a(11) and a(12) were calculated by Harborth and Krause. - _Jörgen Backelin_, Jan 07 2016"""@en .

On the other hand, a(6) < 17, since any triangle free graph with independence number less than six and at least 17 vertices has exactly 17 vertices and cannot be regular, but all cyclic graphs are regular.
Thus, indeed, a(6) = 16."""@en .
