# seqwebdata

_**SeqWeb** is to the OEIS as DBpedia is to Wikipedia._<br>
Project and systems level documentation may be found at the [SeqWeb website](https://www.seqweb.org/)

This `seqwebdata` repo is the SeqWeb analog of the `oeis/oeisdata` repo.

The `seqwebdata` repo has three top-level folders: 
- `seq/` which mirrors the structure of the corresponding `oeisdata` repo folder, 
- `ontology/` which provides the SeqWeb knowledge graph's usual definitions, schemas and other modeling collateral, and  
- `entities/` which provides homes for the different types on non-sequence entities in the SeqWeb
